                                the server has more data available. The value is opaque
                                and may be used to issue another request to the endpoint
                                that served this list to retrieve the next set of
                                available objects. Continuing a consistent list may
                                not be possible if the server configuration has changed
                                or more than a few minutes have passed. The resourceVersion
                                field returned when using this continue value will
                                be identical to the value in the first response, unless
                                you have received this token from an error message.

                              description: remainingItemCount is the number of subsequent
                                items in the list which are not included in this list
                                response. If the list request contained label or field
                                selectors, then the number of remaining items is unknown
                                and the field will be left unset and omitted during
                                serialization. If the list is complete (either because
                                it is not chunking or because this is the last chunk),
                                then there are no more remaining items and this field
                                will be left unset and omitted during serialization.
                                Servers older than v1.15 do not set this field. The
                                intended use of the remainingItemCount is *estimating*
                                the size of a collection. Clients should not rely
                                on the remainingItemCount to be set or to be exact.
