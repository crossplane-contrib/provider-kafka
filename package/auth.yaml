    # Storing Credentials as a Kubernetes Secret
    Kafka credentials may be supplied as a Kubernetes `Secret`. Credentials will
    be stored in this control plane and will only be accessible to installed
    providers.

    Credentials should be provided in the following format:
    ```
      {
        "brokers":[
          "kafka-dev-0.kafka-dev-headless:9092"
        ],
        "sasl":{
          "mechanism":"PLAIN",
          "username":"user",
          "password":"<your-password>"
        }
      }
    ```
    See the [provider-kafka
    documentation](https://github.com/crossplane-contrib/provider-kafka/blob/main/README.md)
    for more information on how to generate credentials.
